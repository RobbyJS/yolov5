## Introduction
This repository is forked from [YOLOv5 repository](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5). 

Compared to that repository, this one simply includes a [Colab notebook](https://github.com/RobbyJS/yolov5/blob/master/xView_YOLOv5_V2.ipynb) that allows performing training and testing over xView dataset. It includes another notebook with an [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/RobbyJS/yolov5/blob/master/xView_NT-EDA_Split.ipynb).

## Reports
This repository is part of a project for Udacity Machine Learning Engineer nanodegree. The two reports necessary to pass the project are in the [reports](https://github.com/RobbyJS/yolov5/tree/master/reports) folder.

## Downloading the dataset
To download the dataset, simply follow these steps:
1. Create an account at http://xviewdataset.org/
2. Go to download section, agree to the terms, and download the data. Only the Training images and Labels will be used in this capstone project.
